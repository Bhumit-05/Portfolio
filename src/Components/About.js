            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Bhumit Janghel, a passionate second-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at NIT Raipur. My academic journey began at Sri Sankara Vidyalaya, Sector-10, Bhilai, where I completed my class 10th. I continued my education at BSP SSS-10, Bhilai, for my class 12th studies. Currently, I reside in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh.</p>
            <p className='mt-[40px]'>Beyond academics, I have a deep love for sports and e-games. I am proud to be a state-level cricket player, which reflects my dedication and enthusiasm for athletics. Alongside my sporting achievements, I have a profound passion for coding. The world of programming fascinates me, and I relish every opportunity to solve problems and build innovative solutions. My interests in both sports and technology shape my dynamic approach to life and learning.</p>
